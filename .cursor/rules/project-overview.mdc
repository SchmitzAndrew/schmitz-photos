# Project Overview

## Overview

This is a personal website/ photo gallery with a strong focus on design and on mobile usability. 

I'm planning on having two seperate pages: a homepage and a gallery. 

### Homepage

A cloud of selected photos that float around central text that says schmitz. photos. The photos's position in the cloud should move according to 
the mouse or the gyroscope in the phone. 

Underneath the cloud include some text. 

### Gallery

A variety of React Components that showcases photos in cool ways. 


## Design 

I don't want to have photos load in, everything should be seamless. 


## Devlopment

Use pnpm
